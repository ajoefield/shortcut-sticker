### The Browse Page Breakthrough
Connected the frontend to the database for the first time. Seeing real VS Code and Vim shortcuts populate the tiles was a magical moment - the app finally felt alive with real data.

### The Global CSS Battle
Hit a wall with Tailwind classes being overridden by global styles. Made the pragmatic decision to switch to inline CSS. Sometimes you have to choose progress over perfection in the MVP phase.

### Adding Heart to the App
Implemented the favorites feature with heart icons. The UX challenge: how to show favorites without cluttering the interface. Solution: only show hearts when searching, keeping the browse view clean.

### The Zoom Vision
Had the idea for a focus/zoom feature when users click tiles. This turned into a beautiful modal experience with blurred backgrounds - sometimes the best features come from "what if we could..." moments.

### Search Within Search
Realized users would need to search within an app's shortcuts when viewing all of them. Added a conditional search bar that only appears when needed. Good UX is invisible UX.

### The VIM Data Quality Moment
While testing, noticed some VIM commands aren't displaying correctly. This is the reality of working with scraped data - you need multiple passes to get it right. Added to the bug fix backlog.
