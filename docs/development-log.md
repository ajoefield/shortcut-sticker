## Technical Architecture
### Stack Decisions
- **Frontend**: React + React Router + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Express.js + Prisma ORM + PostgreSQL
- **Data Processing**: Python scripts for PDF extraction
- **Styling Approach**: Tailwind with inline CSS fallbacks
- **State Management**: React useState hooks (no external library needed)

### Key Technical Challenges Solved
- Global CSS conflicts resolved with inline styles
- Responsive design across mobile and desktop
- Database relationships and foreign key constraints
- PDF text extraction and data cleaning
- Duplicate prevention in seeding process

## Current Status
- **Frontend**: All core pages implemented with interactive features
- **Backend**: Express server with Prisma + PostgreSQL, seeded with 2 apps
- **Database**: 200+ shortcuts across VS Code and Vim
- **UI/UX**: Consistent design system with responsive navigation
- **Data Pipeline**: Automated PDF → CSV → Database workflow
